#Lab 1 Questions
What changes did we make to the original data?
We first added area in square kilometers and population density to the attribute table. Thean, a gradient color distribution were added to symbolize population density on the map. 
And lastly, we added an advanced filter that highlights counties that have asian populations greater than 100,000.

How can the choices we made in changing the data be problematic?
Changes made to the data can be problematic because it can be bias towards the coder's perspective, and has a potential to 
leave out asian populations less than 100,000 from being marked significant on the map. As a result, the data would only favor asian populations that live in a denser area.
